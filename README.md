# Height vs Weight Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model built in Python to predict a person's weight based on their height.  
It uses randomly generated data (synthetic dataset) and trains the model using **scikit-learn**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Generates random dataset of height (cm) and weight (kg).
- Fits a **Linear Regression** model.
- Plots the regression line against actual data points.
- Allows **user input** to predict weight for a given height.
